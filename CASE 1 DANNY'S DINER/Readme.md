## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all ```customer_id``` level purchases with an corresponding ```order_date``` and ```product_id``` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|      
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |     
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |    
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|B          |2021-01-01|2         |
|B          |2021-01-02|2         |
|B          |2021-01-04|1         |
|B          |2021-01-11|1         |
|B          |2021-01-16|3         |
|B          |2021-02-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-07|3         |

 </details>

### **```menu```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The menu table maps the ```product_id``` to the actual ```product_name``` and price of each menu item.

|product_id |product_name|price     |
|-----------|------------|----------|
|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **```members```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the ```join_date``` when a ```customer_id``` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |

 </details>

## üöÄ Solutions

### **Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id,
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_spent
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

---

### **Q2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT (DISTINCT order_date) AS visited_days
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

|customer_id|visited_days|
|-----------|------------|
|A          |4           |
|B          |6           |
|C          |2           |


---

### **Q3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

```sql
WITH cte_order AS (
  SELECT
    sales.customer_id,
    menu.product_name,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
     PARTITION BY sales.customer_id
      ORDER BY 
        sales.order_date,  
        sales.product_id
    ) AS item_order
    FROM dannys_diner.sales
    JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)
SELECT * FROM cte_order
WHERE item_order = 1;
```

**Result:**
| customer_id | product_name | item_order |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| A           | sushi        | 1          |
| B           | curry        | 1          |
| C           | ramen        | 1          |

---

### **Q4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**
```sql
SELECT
  menu.product_name,
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS order_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY
  menu.product_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

|product_id|product_name|order_count|
|----------|------------|-----------|
|3         |ramen       |8          |

---

### **Q5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**

```sql
WITH cte_order_count AS (
  SELECT
    sales.customer_id,
    menu.product_name,
    COUNT(*) as order_count
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu
    ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
  GROUP BY 
    customer_id,
    product_name
  ORDER BY
    customer_id,
    order_count DESC
),
cte_popular_rank AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_count DESC) AS rank
  FROM cte_order_count
)
SELECT * FROM cte_popular_rank
WHERE rank = 1;
```

---

### **Q6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**

**Note:** In this question, the orders made during the join date are counted within the first order as well</span>

```sql
WITH cte_first_after_mem AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    order_date,
    RANK() OVER(
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date) AS purchase_order
  FROM membership_validation
  WHERE membership = 'X'
)
SELECT * FROM cte_first_after_mem
WHERE purchase_order = 1;
```

| customer_id | product_name | order_date               | purchase_order |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| A           | curry        | 2021-01-07T00:00:00.000Z | 1              |
| B           | sushi        | 2021-01-11T00:00:00.000Z | 1              |

---

### **Q7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**

```sql
WITH cte_last_before_mem AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    order_date,
    RANK() OVER(
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS purchase_order
  FROM membership_validation
  WHERE membership = ''
)
SELECT * FROM cte_last_before_mem
--since we used the ORDER BY DESC in the query above, the order 1 would mean the last date before the customer join in the membership
WHERE purchase_order = 1;
```

| customer_id | product_name | order_date               | purchase_order |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| A           | sushi        | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 1              |
| A           | curry        | 2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z | 1              |
| B           | sushi        | 2021-01-04T00:00:00.000Z | 1              |

---

### **Q8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
```sql
WITH cte_spent_before_mem AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    price
  FROM membership_validation
  WHERE membership = ''
)
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  SUM(price) AS total_spent,
  COUNT(*) AS total_items
FROM cte_spent_before_mem
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id | total_spent | total_items |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 25          | 2           |
| B           | 40          | 3           |


---

### **Q9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  SUM(
  CASE WHEN product_name = 'sushi'
  THEN (price * 20)
  ELSE (price * 10)
  END
  ) AS total_points
FROM membership_validation
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id | total_points |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A           | 860          |
| B           | 940          |
